## Main Features:

- URL Shortening
- Visitor Counting
- URL deletion 
- Authorization System
- High performance database with [bolt](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt)
- [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) integration
- Easy Docker Deployment

## Server Installation

### Standard

Since we don't provide prebuild binaries, you have to build it yourself. For that you need Golang and Git installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxibanki/golang-url-shortener # Clone repository
cd golang-url-shortener                                     # Go into it
go get -v ./...                                             # Fetch dependencies
go build                                                    # Build executable
./golang-url-shortener                                      # Run it
```
### Docker Compose

Only execute the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and adjust the environment variables to your needs.

### Configuration:

The configuration is a yaml based file of key value pairs. It is located in the installation folder and is called `config.yml`:

```json
{
    "General": {
        "DBPath": "main.db", // Location of the bolt DB database
        "ListenAddr": ":8080", // Listen address of the http server (IP:Port)
        "ShortedIDLength": 4 // Length of the random generated ID
    },
    "OAuth": {
        "Google": {
          "ClientID": "", // Google client ID
          "ClientSecret": "" // Google client secret
        }
    }
}
```

## Clients:

### General

There is a mechanism integrated, that you can call the `POST` endpoints with the following techniques:
- application/json
- application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- multipart/form-data

### [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) Configuration

This URL Shortener has fully support with ShareX. To use it, just import the configuration to your ShareX. For that you need to open the `Destination settings` => `Other / Custom uploaders` => `Import` => `From Clipboard` menu.

After you've done this, you need to set it as your standard URL Shortener. For that go back into your main menu => `Destinations` => `URL Shortener` => `Custom URL Shortener`.

```json
{
  "Name": "Golang URL Shortener",
  "DestinationType": "URLShortener",
  "RequestType": "POST",
  "RequestURL": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/create",
  "Arguments": {
    "URL": "$input$"
  },
  "ResponseType": "Text",
  "URL": "$json:URL$"
}
```

### Curl

#### Create

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"URL":"https://www.google.de/"}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/create
```
```json
{
    "URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/dgUV",
}
```

#### Info

```bash
$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"ID":"dgUV"}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/info
```
```json
{
    "URL": "https://google.com/",
    "VisitCount": 1,
    "CreatedOn": "2017-10-29T23:35:48.2977548+01:00",
    "LastVisit": "2017-10-29T23:36:14.193236+01:00"
}
```

### HTTP Endpoints:

#### `/api/v1/create` POST

Create is the handler for creating entries, you need to provide only an `URL`. The response will always be JSON encoded and contain an URL with the short link.

####  `/api/v1/info` POST

This handler returns the information about an entry. This includes:
- Created At
- Last Visit
- Visitor counter

For that you need to send a field `ID` to the backend.

## Why did you built this?

Just only because I want to extend my current self hosted URL shorter and learn about new techniques like Go unit testing and react.

## TODO

Next changes sorted by priority

- [x] Fix handler unit tests
- [x] Switch configuration to Yaml
- [ ] Add Authorization (oAuth2 e.g. Google)
- [ ] Add Deletion functionality (depends on the authorization)
- [ ] Refactore Unit Tests
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add ability to track the visitors (Referrer, maybe also live)
- [ ] Create Makefile for building everything
- [ ] Test docker-compose installation
- [ ] Provide image on the docker hub
